## Session 1 — 2026-04-10

**Completed agents:** `prompt_parser`, `ambiguity_scorer`, `defaults_agent`

**Block 1 (Intent) fully green.**

| Agent | Tests | Commit |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `prompt_parser` | 15/15 | `df07e46` |
| `ambiguity_scorer` | 8/8 | `3df71e3` |
| `defaults_agent` | 7/7 | `89aa124` |

**Infrastructure built:**
- `agent/shared/intent_spec.py` — validate/load/save, REQUIRED_FIELDS, DEFAULTS
- `agent/shared/decision_log.py` — append-only JSONL audit log
- `agent/shared/state.py` — TaskGraph (Redis) + SkillsStore (append-only FS)
- `pyproject.toml` — setuptools, pytest, ruff configured
- Git remote: `git@github.com:routifai/meta-builder.git`

**Known gaps opened:**
- `agent/__main__.py` missing
- `agent/monitor/health_server.py` missing

---

## Session 2 — 2026-04-11

**Completed agents:** `researcher`

**Search layer added:** Tavily primary / Anthropic built-in `web_search_20260209` fallback (`agent/shared/search.py`).

| Agent | Tests | Commit |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `researcher` | 4/4 | `95e6779` |

**Functional smoke harness added:**
- `scripts/smoke.py` — live CLI runner, feeds real goals through the pipeline
- `tests/functional/` — session-scoped fixtures, 30 real-API assertions
- `tests/functional/conftest.py` — `pipeline_run` + `pipeline_run_mcp` session fixtures

**Gaps found by smoke run and fixed (`2696d99`):**
1. Unmapped `build_target` values silently dropped from research — added raw-slug fallback
2. Domain research was sequential — switched to `asyncio.gather` (concurrent)
3. Unit tests wrote to real `skills/` dir — fixed to use `tmp_path` via `skills_dir=` param
4. `test_domains_cover_integrations` always skipped — added `TestMCPPipelineResearch` class

## Session 3 — 2026-04-12

**Completed agents:** `architect`

**Mesh block integration test unskipped:** researcher ‖ architect now run concurrently in test.

| Agent | Tests | Commit |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `architect` | 4/4 unit + 1 integration | `(pending)` |

**Architect design:**
- Anthropic SDK tool use with `tool_choice` forced to `define_architecture`
- Loads pre-existing skill docs from `skills_dir` for domain context
- Runs concurrently with researcher (receives empty `research_result` in production)
- Returns `file_tree`, `module_interfaces`, `dependencies`, `tech_choices`

**Functional tests added:** `tests/functional/test_architect_output.py` — 10 tests
- Shape assertions (file_tree is list[str], every module has input/output, etc.)
- Domain coherence (tech_choices reference the build_target and integrations)
- Insight: architect runs without research output — alignment test was wrong, corrected to test standalone coherence

**Current pipeline coverage (functional):**
```
prompt_parser → ambiguity_scorer → defaults_agent → [researcher ‖ architect]
```

**Agents remaining:** coder, tester, deployer, monitor_setup, signal_collector,
scorer, router, log_watcher, anomaly_classifier, context_builder, fix_agent,
validator, skills_updater (13 agents)
